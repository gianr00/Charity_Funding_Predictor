## Objective:

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool to help select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. Their business team provided a [charity_data.csv](Resources/charity_data.csv) dataset containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The dataset has a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

* **EIN** and **NAME**—Identification columns
* **APPLICATION_TYPE**—Alphabet Soup application type
* **AFFILIATION**—Affiliated sector of industry
* **CLASSIFICATION**—Government organization classification
* **USE_CASE**—Use case for funding
* **ORGANIZATION**—Organization type
* **STATUS**—Active status
* **INCOME_AMT**—Income classification
* **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS**—Special consideration for application
* **ASK_AMT**—Funding amount requested
* **IS_SUCCESSFUL**—Was the money used effectively
